NeuralNetwork
This Project include 7 part

1.Get start to build a nerual networfk to classify random points

2.Use the multicategory PTA for digit(Minst handwriting number) classification roughly without libaries

3.Write a competitive learning based image compressor

4.Use a neural network for curve fitting (backpropagation algorithm)

5.Use the backpropagation algorithm for digit(Minst) classification without libaries after processing of the data

6.LSTM ( long short term memeray). Generate a making sense name.

7.reinforcement learning for a little game.
